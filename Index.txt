I am a new member of the spring 2019 batch working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science.

I'm from Hyderabad, India. I did my bachelor's in  Computer Science from MVSR engineering college affiliated to Osmania University.

I want to be a full stack web developer and to reach my goal the knowledge I have is limited so this course would definitely help me to achieve it. At the end of the semester with the hands-on experience I gain, I'm sure that I'll reach my goal.
